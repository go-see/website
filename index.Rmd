### Mission

The **Global Open Series in Environmental Economics** (GoSee) is a global, open-source network of professionals working to develop solutions for the most pressing environmental challenges of our time. Our goal: Evidence-based solutions that inform policy and can be easily implemented. As such, we aim to bring together academics, policymakers, NGOs, and the private sector to strengthen the connection between the interests of research communities and the needs of individuals on the ground who seek sound and implementable solutions.

<br>

We hope that this series breaks down many traditional barriersâ€”across institutions, nations, classes, _etc._ All are welcome.

<br>

Our next remote meeting on **16 September 2020 will discuss forests and natural-resource economics**. Please see [our schedule](https://gosee.io/schedule.html) for more information.
