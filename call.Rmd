Crisis often leads to innovations that were already available but unexploited. By relying on online technologies such as Zoom, we currently have an incredible ability to scale up academic and policy-oriented workshops at minimal cost, allowing for broader participation, increased inclusion, and a greater diversity of voices.

## **Format**

<br>

Each GoSee workshop will last two hours and will typically feature four papers (15 minutes, each), discussants (5 minutes each), and additional Q&A with the audience. We will also consider shorter presentations (5 minutes) without discussants, for projects that are at initial stages. Papers for 15-minute presentations should be developed enough for a presentation that stresses data, methods, results, or solutions that can easily be implemented on the ground. Some workshops will have more of a roundtable format, with presentations by policymakers, NGOs or private sector on research needs.

Each workshop will be recorded and posted on here. We will develop a discussion board for additional questions and comments

## **Registration and/or submission**

#### When will I present?

A unique feature of GoSee is that everybody will have a chance to present. Of course, what you want to know is when. The role of those putting the workshops together is to identify groups of 4 papers that fit together around specific themes while maximizing global representation.

#### Submission details

Given the structure of GoSee workshops, we will accept submissions on a rolling basis, starting Friday, April 3rd. Authors can submit individual papers or complete proposals for workshops. Proposals for workshops will typically require that papers come from a diverse group of participants (not just the usual suspects).

#### Initial thematic areas

While this list is far from complete, to facilitate the rapid organization of workshops for April and May, we are particularly interested in submissions from scholars working in the following areas:

- **Climate Change:** mitigation, adaptation, advances in econometric methods, advances in integrated models
- **Smart Cities:** *e.g.*, novel uses of big data in the design and management of cities
- **Inequality in access and outcomes:** environmental justice, inequalities in adaptation, inequalities in exposure, solutions to inequality
- **Energy Systems:** electrification, transportation, renewable energy, grid, markets
- **Environmental Quality:** air, water, etc.
- Political Economy, Property Rights, and Institutions
- **Coupled Systems:** epid-econ systems, climate-econ systems, etc.
- **Resource Management:** fisheries, forests, ground water, land use, etc
